# Cake-Shop E-Commerce Application Website

Hi, thanks for looking about my stuff, in this project I will create an online e-commerce website to a fake cake shop business. 

## Documentation About the Product

In the documentation folder, there are the documents exchanged between the client and the developer.

Along the development cycle, the updates exchanged on a regular basis will be included in an exchanges folder.

There is also a company's folder with the project requirements, technologies used, use case model and database model.

## Technologies Used

The project will use Typescript in both backend and frontend. 
The backend will use NodeJS, Express, Typegoose, MongoDB and Jest.
The frontend will use ReactJS.
